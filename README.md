# RCL-i4
V-Slot based 3D printer based on the general shape of a Prusa i3 but, ya know, not :D

> I know that there are currently errors with bolt length and qty in the BOM we found them in the initial build session but they have yet to be corrected.

This printer utilizes a bed leveling strategy similar to the Lulzbot Taz 6, but currently does not have the nozzle wipe or z limit activated in the start g-code or firmware,
  **Use at your own Risk**

The goal of the RCL-i4 was to create a 3D printer that would be able to quickly be created in the [RiverCityLabs.org](http://rivercitylabs.org) (RCL) maker space in Peoria, IL using their tools. The printed parts are kept to a minimum to allow for quick easy manufacture with sheet materials on either the laser cutter or the CNC router.

The entire design was created in Autodesk Fusion360 and I will be uploading the source models soon. *Sooner if there is a demand for them.*

Thanks to the following companies and individuals for giving their support, advice time to help RCL make this project possible
- [SMW3D.com](http://smw3d.com) - supplied a quick easy BOM ordering method for us
- [E3D-online.com](http://e3d-online.com) - Worked with us to figure out an easy way to do nozzle based bed leveling
- [Lulzbot.com](http://lulzbot.com) - Worked with me to give me a better under standing of how the bed leveling on the TAZ 6 was done
